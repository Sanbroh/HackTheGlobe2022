# Product description:
With Rescue, we provide a solution to all these issues. Rescue is a decentralized platform for government and NGOs alike, as well as the global community to help distribute aid resources to dislocated citizens. 

Our model focuses on removing the barriers between donors and people they want to help, which requires a decentralized system to avoid corruption and increase transparency.

# Problem
We have identified a lack of transparency, inefficient resource distribution, and incorrect resources being distributed as the three main problems with aid distribution today.

Humanitarian aid is often required in countries with weak institutions and high levels of corruption. This causes donors to question if their aid is reaching its desired recipients which could lead to a decrease in future donations.
